As the room type is given (small, large, pysics, etc) and as the course should run in only one of the rooms of the same type, we only have to take these rooms into account for each course instead of making propositions of all the rooms.(E.g. For the input given above for a class of cs201 the propositions of the room is cs201_t1, cs201_t2. And the constraint will be exactly one of these is true. )\n",
